# Python Project 2

Project used to practice creating and writing files.


Included soccer_players file contains a table of kids that must be evenly distributed based on their previous soccer experience into 3 teams.

Download and run the file to get the outputs in their own folder as:
- teams.txt = all of the teams and their players listed out
- individual welcome letters = files named after the players and includes basic info


Practiced Python Topics:
- working with random to get a number in a specified range
- working with os to create a new folder
- conditional statements
- dunder '__main__'
- with open - to work on files and close them afterwards automatically
- for loops/iteration
- creating files and writing to them
